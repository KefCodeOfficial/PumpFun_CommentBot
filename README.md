#### Method:
- Fast requests, no browser! ðŸš€
  
#### Language:
- Python
  
#### Functions:
- Continuously searches for new coins that have been launched on PumpFun, checks if the coin has at least one social link (X or Telegram), creates a Solana wallet, logs into PumpFun and posts a comment under the coin. 

- The bot has mechanisms that make the comments look different each time, without it being visible to the reader. This way, the comments remain active for a long time and are not deleted after just a few seconds!

#### Info:
- You need residential proxies to run it.
